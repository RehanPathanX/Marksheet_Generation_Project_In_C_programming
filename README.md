# Marksheet Generation for School Students

This project is a command-line-based program written in C for generating a student's marksheet. It was developed in the first semester of my BCA course using the Turbo C++ editor. The project collects student details, calculates their grades and percentages, and displays the result in a structured format, similar to a standard marksheet page.

## Project Overview

The **Marksheet Generation** program performs the following tasks:
- Collects basic student details: 
  - Name
  - Date of Birth (DOB)
  - Mother's Name
- Collects subject-wise marks for school subjects.
- Automatically calculates:
  - Total marks
  - Percentage
  - Grade based on percentage
- Displays the output in a formatted marksheet layout.

### Features
- Simple, command-line interface.
- Automatic percentage and grade calculation.
- Structured output, displaying results in a readable marksheet format.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C
- **Development Environment**: Turbo C++
- **Platform**: Command-line interface (CLI)


## How to Run

1. Open the Turbo C++ IDE or any compatible C compiler.
2. Load the `main.c` file into the IDE.
3. Compile and run the program.
4. Input the required student details and subject marks as prompted.
5. The program will display the marksheet with calculated grades and percentage.
